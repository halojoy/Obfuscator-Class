# PHP Obfuscator

Simple and effective Obfuscator PHP class (this is not a stupid `base64 encoding` script, but a real and effective obfuscation script)


## Overview

If you want to keep your open source code private, but working on all Web hosting. This **Obfuscator** class is the obfuscator you need!

Not easy readable by developers (unless they are ready to spend lot of time). This will really discourage them :smiley:


## Usage

### Example 1

```PHP
<?php
require 'Obfuscator.class.php';

$sData = <<<'DATA'
    echo 'This is my PHP code, can be class class, interface, trait,... in PHP 5, 7, 7.2, ..., etc.';
DATA;

$sObfusationData = new Obfuscator($sData, 'Class/Code NAME');
file_put_contents('my_obfuscated_data.php', $sObfusationData);
```

### Example 2

```PHP
<?php
require 'Obfuscator.class.php';

$sData = <<<'DATA'
    $hour = date('H');

    echo 'The hour (of the server) is ' . date('H:i');
    echo ', and will give the following message:<br><br>';

    if ($hour < 10) {
        echo 'Have a good morning!';
    } elseif ($hour < 20) {
        echo 'Have a good day!';
    } else {
        echo 'Have a good night! zZz z';
    }
DATA;

$sObfusationData = new Obfuscator($sData, 'Give a name');
file_put_contents('obfuscated_code.php', $sObfusationData);
```

Run `obfuscated_code.php` file and you will see something like below:

**The hour (of the server) is 19, and will give the following message: Have a good day!**


### Example 3

```PHP
<?php
require 'Obfuscator.class.php';

$filename = 'myphpfile.php'; // A PHP filename (without .php) that you want to obfuscate

$sData = file_get_contents($filename);
$sObfusationData = new Obfuscator($sData, 'Class/Code NAME');
file_put_contents('obfuscated.php', $sObfusationData);
```


## Requirement

* PHP 5.2 or higher (works with PHP 7.*+ as well!)


## History

I first created it for my needs, especially for the license file of my [pH7CMS Software](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS) in early 2014 but now (summer 2016), I don't need to keep this project private and want to share it for the others (hoping it will help you and saving time!).

I did change anything since the first version and didn't review it, so could be improved. Feel free to add your improvements by forking it and create a new PR. It will be a pleasure for me to see your contribution!


FYI, in 3 years, I never found my obfuscated code unobfuscated (and one project which is [pH7CMS](https://sourceforge.net/p/ph7socialdating) had been downloaded by over 50,000 users) so you can be quite confident (however as you can understand, I cannot give any guarantee on it).
